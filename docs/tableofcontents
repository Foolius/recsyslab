Remarks:
    -should I have subsection 3.1 and 3.2?
    -I changed "3 Technical Background" I think "Recommendation Algorithms" describes better what is in this section
    -Name of SVD: In the paper where I took the code from ("Collaborative Filtering Ensemble for Ranking") they call it just SVD, so I took what you wrote down.
    -Should section 9 look like above or more like "9 Conclusions" for example?
