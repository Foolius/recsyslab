FUNCTIONS
    split(R, seed)
        Splits a database into two dicts.
        
        Splits after the leave-one-out method which means for every user in the
        database it takes one item out of the database and into a new one.
        The first returned dict is the database with one item missing for each
        user. The second returned dict has the missing items.
        
        R is a dict of the database.
        seed is a seed for the randomness.
    
    splitMatrix(M, seed)
        Splits a matrix into two new dicts.

        testR is a dict with an internal UserID as a dict and a list of items as
        values. Normally testR is the second dict split.split returns.
        The list can have a lenght greater than 1.
        
        recommender is a function which takes an internal UserID and n and returns
        n items recommender for the UserID.
        
        n is the number of items the recommender can recommend.
        
        hits = number of items from testR the recommender guessed right.

    normRowSum          --  normalize a matrix by the sum
    cache               --  cache results of a function
    writeOrigToFile     --  save a DB with original IDs
    writeInternalToFile --  save a DB with internal IDs
    sortList            --  sort a list with scores and IDs
    listToSet           --  convert a list into a set
    sortResults         --  sort test results
    printMatrix         --  print a matrix

    getScoreMF          --  compute the score of an item

CLASSES
    __builtin__.object
        idOrigDict
    
    class idOrigDict(__builtin__.object)
     |  Class two map external/original IDs to internal IDs and vice versa.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Initialization.
     |  
     |  add(self, orig)
     |      Add a new original ID.
     |      
     |      Returns the internal ID the passed original ID got mapped to.
     |      If the passed ID is already mapped nothing happens except the
     |      mapped internal ID is returned.
     |  
     |  getId(self, orig)
     |      Returns the internal ID which is mapped to the passed orinigal ID.
     |  
     |  getOrig(self, id)
     |      Returns the original ID which is mapped to the passed internal ID.
     |  
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |  
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables (if defined)
     |  
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object (if defined)

FUNCTIONS
    cache(fn)
        Decorator to cache the result of the function fn.
    
    dictToMatrix(d)
        Converts a dict like reader.getR() returns to a matrix.
    
    getExternalRec(getRec, r)
        Converts getRec so it takes and returns only the original IDs.
        
        r   --  reader object
    
    getScoreMF(origUid, origIid, W, H, r)
        Returns the score of one item for one user with an MF model.
        origUid --  original User ID
        origIid --  original Item ID
        W, H    --  The MF model like returned by recommender.mf for example
        r       --  a reader object with the database
    
    listToSet(sortedscorelist, n)
        Converts a list into a set with size n.
        
        Gets a list like sortList returns and returns a set with the first n
        items, or less, when there are not enough items
    
    normRowNorm(m)
        Normalize the matrix in place so each row of the matrix has norm 1.
    
    normRowSum(m)
        Normalize the matrix in place so each row of the matrix has sum 1.
    
    printMatrix(m)
        Prints a whole matrix.
        
        Prints the whole matrix m without replacing stuff with dots
        like it normally does when the matrix is to large.
    
    randDataset(user, items, p, seed, filename)
        Generates a random dataset and writes it into a file.
        
        user    --  number of users
        items   --  number of items
        p       --  percentage of ones in the dataset
        seed    --  seed for the randomness
    
    sortList(scorelist)
        Gets a list of tuples (itemid, score), sorts by score decreasing.
    
    sortResults(name)
        Sort test results written to a file.
    
    writeInternalToFile(reader, toSave, filename)
        Writes a database into a file with the internal IDs.
        
            reader  --  reader object
            toSave  --  Part of the database to write
            filename--  Name of the file
        
        Writes toSave into a file with the name filename.
    
    writeOrigToFile(reader, toSave, filename)
        Writes a database into a file with the original IDs.
        
            reader  --  reader object
            toSave  --  Part of the database to write
            filename--  Name of the file
        
        Writes toSave into a file with the name filename but first the
        internal IDs in toSave get mapped to the original IDs.
