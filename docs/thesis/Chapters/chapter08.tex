\chapter{Conclusions}
As we saw in \ref{usermanual} recsyslab is quite easy to use.
Also we saw in \ref{results} that our library achieves acceptable results.
However the results could probably get improved by searching better 
hyperparameters.


\section{Future work}
For future work we could implement more algorithms and evaluation metrics.
