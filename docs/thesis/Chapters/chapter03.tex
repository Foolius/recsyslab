\chapter{Related Work}

There is a wide range of projects providing implemantions for recommender
system. Some of them are described in this chapter to give a quick
overview and comparison.


\section{MyMediaLite}

MyMediaLite\cite{key-1} is an open source project developed at the
University of Hildesheim and provides several algorithm for rating
prediction and item prediction. It is written in C\# and is used with
a command line interface. It also provides a graphical interface to
demonstrate recommender algorithms


\section{PREA (Personalized Recommendation Algorithms Toolkit)}

PREA\cite{key-2} is an open source project written in Java. It provides
a wide range of recommender algorithms and evaluation metrics to test
them. It is maintained by the Georgia Institute of Technology.


\section{Apache Mahout}

Mahout\cite{key-6} is an open source library in java. It is implemented
on top of Apache Hadoop, so it uses the map/reduce paradigm. This
means it can run on different independent computers.


\section{Duine Framework}

The Duine Framework \cite{key-7} is an open source project written
in java by the Telematica Instituut/Novay. The recommender of the
Duine Framework combines multiple prediction techniques to exploit
the strengths of the different techniques and to avoid their weaknesses.


\section{Cofi}

Cofi \cite{key-8}provides an algorithm for the rating prediction
task called Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization. It is open source
and written in C++.


\section{LensKit}

Lenskit \cite{key-9} is a toolkit which provides several recommender
algorithms and an infrastructure to evaluate them. It is an open source
project by the University of Minnesota
